# ü§ñ AI Agent API for Car Dealership Analysis

This project implements a **FastAPI-based REST API** that uses AI agents (CrewAI + Gemini) to analyze car dealerships in the U.S. The API provides two main features:

1. **Identify local competitors based on the dealership OEM and proximity**
2. **Discover locations(Cities or metro areas) considered as opportunities to target in the SEO strategy**
